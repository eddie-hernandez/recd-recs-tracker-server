# Rec'd Recs Tracker!

**New Year? New Music!**

I must say, there's few things in this world I love recommending as much as I love recommending a good ol' classic album I fancy. Incredibly so, there are good souls in my circle who repay the favor and share albums they think I should listen to! But the fact of the matter is, I have such a hard time keeping track of what I have and haven't listened to already. That's why I created Rec'd Recs â€“ a tracker that allows you to add, see, edit, and delete any album anyone has recommended to you! Last year, I personally actually used a google spreadsheet to track all of this information down, but this time around, we're goin' full-stack! Users can make an account, see their list of recommended albums, and even add their own liner notes once they're finished listening to a record!
Within the liner notes, users will be able to rate an album, add a track that stood out to them the most, as well as jot any notes down about the album that they feel necessary. Welcome to Rec'd Recs!
