personal 2023 rec'd-recs tracker

new year's resolution â€“ to listen to new music

every release someone recommends in the new year, we can log it!

- once someone listens to an album, they will add a liner note that will rate the album, and add any additional comments about their listening experience (if they want to)
- a user can add a standout track from that album if they wanted to (not required)
- maybe in the "liner notes", a user can add comments about the album


- Collections:
    - records
    - users
    - linerNotes

- a user can have many liner notes (1:M)
- a liner note belongs to one user (1:1)
((together, this is a 1:M relationship))

- a record can have one note (1:1)
((if the note is supposed to be 1 to 1 with a record it should just be an atrribute without a collection))
((if the intention of notes comment / usable / visible to multiple users then it will need owner))

- a record can have many liner notes (1:M)
- a user can have many records (1:M)
- a user can have many liner notes (1:M)
